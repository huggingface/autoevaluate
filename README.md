## Installation

To run the application locally, first clone this repository and install the dependencies as follows:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, copy the example file of environment variables:

```
cp .env.template .env
```

and set the `HF_TOKEN` variable with a valid API token from the `autoevaluator` user. Finally, spin up the application by running:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## AutoTrain configuration details

Models are evaluated by AutoTrain, with the payload sent to the `AUTOTRAIN_BACKEND_API` environment variable. The current configuration for evaluation jobs running on Spaces is:

```
AUTOTRAIN_BACKEND_API=https://api-staging.autotrain.huggingface.co
```

To evaluate models with a _local_ instance of AutoTrain, change the environment to:

```
AUTOTRAIN_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000
```
